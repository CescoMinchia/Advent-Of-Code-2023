# Advent of code 2023

## About
Advent of code is an annual world code challenge.
From 1st of December, a new puzzle is released at the start of each day, like an advent calendar.
The puzzles have increasing difficulty.

You can solve these with any language you want. I chose Python, and I uploaded some of my answers.
