# Instructions
- Given an input, find the shortest path for each pair of galaxies.
- Sum all these distances

# Detailed
Given an input as below:
```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```
For each pair of galaxies, find the shortest path.

Example 1:\
-Shortest distance between galaxy 5 and 9 is 9 (number of "#" symbols + 1).
```
....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
.##.........6
..##.........
...##........
....##...7...
8....9.......
```
Example 2:\
-Shortest distance between galaxy 8 and 9 is 4 (number of "#" symbols + 1).
```
....1........
.........2...
3............

8####9.......
```

Here are some other example shortest path lengths:\
Between galaxy 1 and galaxy 7: 15\
Between galaxy 3 and galaxy 6: 17

In this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path between all 36 pairs of galaxies is 374.
